## post cic bit slice selection
# example:  when selected 0, MSB downto (MSB - 16) output bits from the
# cic filter is selected and fed to the lockin outputs
# when selected 1, MSB-1 downto (MSB - 16) - 1 output bits from the cic
# filter is selected and fed to the lockin outputs
# increasing this value performs the operation of division by powers of 2

## lockin channel enable bits [7:0]
# which lockins are turned on or off (MSB => lockin 8, LSB => lockin 1)
# example:
#     255 decimal = 11111111 binary, all the 8 lockins are active.
#      15 decimal = 00001111 binary, lockins 4..1 are active
#      17 decimal = 00010001 binary, lockins 1 and 5 are active
